				<h2>1. A Rebirth of ARDY’S Media Group - 4th August 2020 00.05</h1>
					<br/>
				<h5>
					Hi. <br/><br/>
					to share my thoughts and ideas, i used to write a lot back then. but these days i’m trying to do a new method of sharing and ‘broadcasting yourself’. maybe you’ve heard that slogan before, yes it’s called youtube.

					
				</h5>
				<br><p>it all started back then when i was in the academy, i meet a friend who taught me how to do videos, from planning, shooting, until the editing. and i got quite a lot of basics to bring this new-way-to-share-thoughts thing into the new level. i learned a lot about editing (J & L cut, jump cut, match cut, transitions, overlay, audio mastering, and such), shooting (framing the video, the angle, and so on), and the art of pre-production (scripting, planning the shots, etc..)<br/><br/>

					thanks ban!</p>

				<div class="cerita">
					<p>fast forward to january 2020, i put my first stone into this youtube thing by posting my first video titled “Apa itu Automatisasi” (automatization) in my youtube channel called “Armuhus”. the name was basically given from my advisor (i know my advisor is a little bit weird but sure he got a lot of ideas) and i use it to name the channel. the video quality is horrendous, the script is poorly planned, and it peformed really bad in terms of algorithm. (but i leared a lot from that ‘failure’)<br/><br/>

					he also gave me the channel, a youtube channel that has just shy number of 10.000 subscribers. i think it’ll be easier for me to kickstart a yt career with that amount of subs, but when i stepped my feet in i only got around 90 views form that 10k subs. that’s a sub-to-view ratio of 100:1, 1 views from around 100 subs. which isn’t good for the algorithm to recommend my video. (i’ll tell more about that later on this blog)</p>
				</div>

				<p>after that first tragedy, i decided to postpone my yt career, and re-shift my focus into my game development thing. (because i got a new ‘hope’ in my mobile game. i won’t explain it any furtner at this juncture.) but alas, a weird disease come into existence and all of my plans were failed to work, i got into a financial disaster and ended up with Rp0 in my back account.<br/><br/>

				i went on into depression, some kind of ‘mental ilness’. (if i can exagerrate it).
				i really stressed because i literally, literally got no money left.
				and my life is backed by my parent (by which i backed them before… i know this is a pity.)
				from this event, i learned that i’ve got no ‘true’ friend who offer or even wants to help me in terms of monetary aspects.</p>

				<div class="cerita">
					<p>but i got my alarm on, i cannot stay in this condiiton any longer.
					i need to wake up, i need to do something else.
					i’m a man, i have to -at least- back myself up. (and then, ofc, my family)<br/><br/>

					from then i went to youtube and search for ‘how to do youtube career’ and i met with graham stephan,
					a US realtor who’s the job is, obviously, selling homes to people.
					but graham isn’t a plain-old realtor, he’s also doing youtube.<br/><br/>

					by which he earned more than $1 million just from youtube ads.
					and i got hooked into his online course ‘How to do youtube career’ so i get myself one.<br/><br/>


					after watched hours and hours of that course, i distill it into my notes app
					(ofc because i used to write down things to make it stick a lot harder to my brain)
					and that i reflect; should i start my yt career now?</p>
				</div>

				<p>i went on to concept a lot of yt channel ideas, 
					from just a regular person-name channel that covers varieties of topics,
					to a very specific personal finance channel.<br/><br/>

					and i chose the first, and i decide it to start in my own native language first.
					because in terms of speaking, my english skill is just so lame.
					i want to make myself as comfortable as possible in the front of camera,
					while improving my english speaking skills.</p>

				<div class="cerita">
					<p>from that decision, i decided to launch my idea that tooks 2 days to plan.
						it named ‘Pengen Mikir’ (wants to think, in a plain english language)
						the idea is to explain things that are hard to understand in an easy way,
						by using simple plain-english language (simplifying the jargons), simple analogies,
						and related examples from our daily lives.<br/><br/>

						by combining those three things i hope i can educate the world with the knowledge that i have.<br/>
						ofc, i’ve said it before, i’ll explain hard things in an easy way, and those hard things are:<br/>

						<ol>
							<li>Economics</li>
							<li>Investment</li>
							<li>Personal Finance</li>
							<li>Politics</li>
							<li>Business</li>
						</ol>

						but besides those 5 topics, i’ll talk about the other things too.
						and i’ll often covers the trending issue, and adding my opinion so i don’t just bandwagon on it to get more views and subs.</p>
				</div>

				<p>i launched it (Pengen Mikir) in 20th July of 2020,
					under the ‘management’ of ARDY’S Media Group.
					(to group all of my media companies)<br/><br/>

					why i called it ‘rebirth’ ?
					because i already got the “Media Group” idea back in the january.
					but i haven’t make armuhus into the ardy’s media group because i decided to postpone it.</p>


				<p class="quotes">i hope things will get back to normal.<br/>
					and my youtube channel will got monetized in this year.<br/>
					and i got my first $100 from youtube in this year.<br/><br/>

					Amen.<br/>
					Aamiin ya rabbal alamin.</p>
